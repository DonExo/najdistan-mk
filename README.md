# Najdistan.mk

An early implementation of my Najdistan.mk project, which was initially intended to be released on the Macedonian web space, and potentially to be used as a place where you can rent or buy your next apartment.

This project was actually built in 2015-16, but came on GitHub in 2017. The project has room for lots of improvements, but eventually I've decided to rework it in a more modern framework.

It is using a very obsolete version of Flask (v0.12) - a now popular Python framework for building web applications. [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) can now be considered a mature and reliable framework, as it has grown tremendously and has given a lot of importance in the python-web world.

This application is hosted on Heroku. It is using a free-tier package, which makes services slow on the initial request (when landing on the web page). Subsequent requests work normally. It can be found at: [Najdistan.mk](http://najdistan-mk.herokuapp.com)
